        My college life is the most difficult stage of my life because there are so many problems I am dealing with. 
        In studies, in my family, in myself. 
        My subjects in my course are on another level. 
        Those are very difficult to understand. 
        But I'm thankful because I have some professors that sharing their knowledge to us. <br><br>
