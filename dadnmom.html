    My father was a security guard at a mall in Quezon City and my mother was a sales lady there. 
    They met when my father, who was known for his serious demeanor and sharp uniform, asked my mother out on a date. 
    She was surprised but thrilled and quickly accepted. They went on many dates and their feelings for each other grew stronger. <br><br>

    However, before they could get married, my mother became pregnant with my oldest brother. 
    It was a scary time for them, but they were determined to make it work. 
    my father worked hard to provide for my family, taking on extra jobs whenever he could, and my mother balanced her job with taking care of my brother and keeping the house in order. 
    They faced many challenges along the way, but their love and dedication to each other and their family helped them overcome all obstacles. <br><br>
