        In my grade school days, this is the time when I met online games. 
        My friends and classmates influenced me on playing online games that's why I got addicted to it. 
        The moment that I learned how to properly play online games, that is the time I'm always staying in the computer shop from day to night. 
        I can't control my addiction but thankfully I didn't fail in my study. <br><br>
