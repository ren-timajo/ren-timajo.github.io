        My high school days is the time that I learned how to fall in love. 
        This is the time when I admired someone and this is the time when I first got hurt emotionally. 
        My first crush became my crush for 2 years. But unfortunately, when the time I confessed my feelings to her. 
        She told me that she already liked someone else. <br><br>
