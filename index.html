    I am a 20-year-old college student at Universidad de Manila, and I enjoy spending my free time watching anime, listening to music, 
    and playing online games. These hobbies allow me to unwind and relax after a long day of school activities. 
    My favorite anime genres include action, adventure, and fantasy, and I am always on the lookout for new and exciting shows to watch.
    
    In my daily routine, I tend to spend most of my time inside my room studying, completing assignments, and participating 
    in virtual classes. However, I make sure to take breaks and indulge in my hobbies to avoid burnout and maintain a healthy 
    work-life balance. I have a preference for colors like blue and black, as they evoke a sense of calm and professionalism, respectively. 
    Overall, I am a dedicated student who knows how to enjoy life outside of academics.<p>
    
    I hope you will be back again for more info,<br>
    Mr. Timajo
