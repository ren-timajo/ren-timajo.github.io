    As a toddler, I was always demanding new toys, much to the frustration of my mother. Whenever we went out to pick up my brother from school, I would beg for new toys, making my mother feel exasperated. Despite her efforts to curb my desire for new toys, there were times when she would give in and buy me what I wanted.<p>
<p>
I distinctly remember my mother buying me lego and robot toys, knowing that they were my favorites. Those were the toys that I would spend hours playing with, building new structures and imagining all sorts of scenarios. Looking back, I realize how patient my mother was with me, constantly having to manage my expectations and desires.<p>
<p>
Now as an adult, I am grateful for my mother's love and patience, and for buying me toys that allowed me to explore my creativity and imagination. Those experiences have helped shape who I am today and have instilled in me the importance of patience and perseverance when it comes to achieving my goals.
